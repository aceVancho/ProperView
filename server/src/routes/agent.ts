// Why is this file empty?

// GET /properties/agent is more resource-focused
// The agent is just a sub-scope

// GET /agent/properties puts "agent" as the resource
// Since we're not user-specific scoping...
// GET /users/:userId/posts
// GET /customers/:id/orders
// I opted to stick with the resource-focused approach
